Replace closeOut by endOfStream?

Write up SCL for CSO -- done, I think

Alternation:
- Extend to buffered channels -- done

- Extend to sending branches -- done

- Examples with clients and servers -- done 

- In SyncChan, have send wait only if receiversWaiting = 0 -- unsound! 

- Implement timed sends/receives in channels -- done

- When repeating, start registering from where the previous round finished. --
  done

- In channels, would it be better for sender to signal on slotEmptied?

- Do final version of Dining Philosophers -- done

- Do rest of datatypes -- done

- Think about restrictions on usage: I think we can't have both ends of a
  SyncChan in alts, but it's ok with a BuffChan.  Do run-time tests for
  enforcement. -- done, but restrictions could be relaxed. 

- Pass channels by name, not value -- that's far from easy!

Calls to maybeReceive, portClosed use lock and block while registering except
for calls concerning earlier iteration.  Main thread notifies them.  Main
thread obtains lock (a) to set registering = true; (b) to set registering =
false and notifyAll (publishes enabled, etc.), and then to wait for signal. 

Is it possible to implement SyncChan with less waiting?  Switch on who is
there first.  Maybe separate locks for sending and receiving. 

Trim linearizability tester?
