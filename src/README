Sorting practical

Dining Philosophers practical: two parts done; need to do version with timeout.

Client-server examples

-----------------

Alternation:
- Extend to buffered channels
- Extend to sending branches
- Think about restrictions on usage
- When repeating, start registering from where the previous round finished.

---------------


Calls to maybeReceive, portClosed use lock and block while registering except
for calls concerning earlier iteration.  Main thread notifies them.  Main
thread obtains lock (a) to set registering = true; (b) to set registering =
false and notifyAll (publishes enabled, etc.), and then to wait for signal. 

Is it possible to implement SyncChan with less waiting?  Switch on who is
there first.  Maybe separate locks for sending and receiving. 

Extend channels with timed operations.

Trim linearizability tester?
