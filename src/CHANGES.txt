        Changes between versions 1.2 and 1.3

The ? and ! type constructors are deprecated.

Allowed the body of "repeat" to give a non-Unit result (which is ignored).

Changes channel operations "close", "endOfStream" and "reopen" so that they
take an empty argument list, e.g. "close()".

Added trait BuffChanT and classes OnePlaceBuffChan and UnboundedBuffChan.

Updated Log to try to detect if two threads used the same "identities" to
write to the log.

Changed fork and run on ThreadGroups so they take an empty argument list,
e.g. "t.fork()"

Changed acquire and release on Locks so they take an empty parameter list.

Changed up and down on semaphores so they take an empty parameter list.

Made the Closed and AltAbort exceptions available without full
quantification.
